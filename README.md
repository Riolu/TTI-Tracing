# csv_check
This is a software designed for tracing Transmission Time Interval (TTI) between Physical Layer and Data Link Layer 
in 5G Mobile Networks to locate and fix latent problems. It could help developers to verify the correlation in a 
certain TTI file (of csv form) or among multiple TTI files in an efficient manner. Developers are able to trace and 
analyze TTIs in batches through a set of self-defined rules. Notice a specialized query language was defined in the 
software, please refer to the user manual for more detailed information.
