This is a software designed for tracing Transmission Time Interval (TTI) between physical layer and data link layer 
in 5G mobile networks to locate and fix problems. It could help developers to verify the correlation in a certain TTI 
file or among multiple TTI files in an efficient manner. Developers are able to trace and analyze TTIs in batches 
through a set of self-defined rules. Notice a specialized query language was defined in the software, please refer to 
the user manual for more detailed information.
