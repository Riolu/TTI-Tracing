# csv_check
This is a software designed for tracing Transmission Time Interval (TTI) between Physical Layer and Data Link Layer 
in 5G Mobile Networks to locate and fix latent problems. It could help developers to verify the correlation in a 
certain TTI file (of csv form) or among multiple TTI files in an efficient manner. 

Developers are able to trace and analyze TTIs in batches through a set of self-defined rules. Notice a specialized 
query language was defined in the software, please refer to the user manual for more detailed information. In addition
to basic calculation and comparison, other functions including Count and TTI searching are realized and integrated in
the software. An analysis report would be generated in the end. The report is given either according to the error rules,
or the error lines, to meet different requirements.
